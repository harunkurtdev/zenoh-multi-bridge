## üéØ Overview

The Zenoh Multi-Protocol Bridge Project is a comprehensive solution designed to enable seamless data transfer between different communication protocols commonly used in IoT, robotics, and distributed systems. This project bridges **Zenoh**, **MQTT**, and **ROS2** protocols, allowing them to work together in modern IoT and robotics ecosystems.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **üîÑ Multi-Protocol Translation**: Seamless data transfer between MQTT, Zenoh, and ROS2 protocols
- **‚ö° Real-Time Communication**: Instant processing of sensor and robotics data
- **üìà Scalable Architecture**: Docker-based microservices structure
- **üìä Monitoring and Control**: Visual flow control with Node-RED
- **ü§ñ Robotics Integration**: ROS2 DDS bridge for robotics applications
- **üß™ Testing Environment**: Comprehensive testable system with multiple protocol support

## üéØ Project Objectives

## üéØ Use Cases

### IoT-Robotics Integration
Connect sensor data from IoT devices (MQTT) to robot control systems (ROS2) for real-time environmental data processing in autonomous robots.

### Hybrid Communication Systems
Integrate legacy MQTT infrastructure with modern Zenoh protocol adoption and ROS2 robotics ecosystem connectivity.

### Research and Development
Provide a multi-protocol testing environment for performance comparison and development sandbox for distributed systems.

### Industrial Automation
Enable communication between SCADA systems (MQTT) and robot controllers (ROS2) with real-time monitoring capabilities.

### Smart City Applications
Facilitate communication between IoT sensors and autonomous vehicles for traffic management and environmental monitoring.
