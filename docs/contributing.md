## Development Setup

### 1. Local Environment

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/zenoh-multi-bridge.git
cd zenoh-multi-bridge

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Build and Test

```bash
# Build custom images
docker-compose build

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Run tests (if available)
./run-tests.sh  # Add this if you create test scripts
```

### 3. Make Changes

- Modify code or configuration files
- Test your changes locally
- Ensure all services still work together

### 4. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Restart affected services
docker-compose restart [service-name]

# Test end-to-end
python3 pub.py  # Terminal 1
python3 sub.py  # Terminal 2

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs | grep -i error
```

## Coding Standards

### Configuration Files

- Use **JSON5** format for Zenoh configurations
- Include comments explaining non-obvious settings
- Follow existing file structure

Example:
```json5
{
  // Client mode connects to existing router
  mode: "client",
  
  // Connection endpoint
  connect: {
    endpoints: ["tcp/zenoh-router:7447"],
  },
  
  // Plugin configuration
  plugins: {
    mqtt: {
      // MQTT server port
      port: "0.0.0.0:1884",
      // Scope prefix for topics
      scope: "mqtt/demo",
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Compose

- Keep service definitions organized
- Use meaningful container names
- Document non-standard ports
- Include restart policies

```yaml
services:
  service-name:
    container_name: service-name
    image: image:tag
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "host:container"  # Document purpose
    environment:
      - VAR_NAME=value
    networks:
      - zenoh-mqtt-net
```

### Documentation

- Use Markdown format
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams where helpful (Mermaid syntax)
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing

1. **Start All Services**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose ps  # Verify all running
   ```

2. **Test MQTT Flow**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Subscribe
   mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 'test/#' -v
   
   # Terminal 2: Publish
   mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1884 -t 'test/msg' -m 'Hello'
   ```

3. **Test Zenoh Flow**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Subscribe
   python3 sub.py
   
   # Terminal 2: Publish
   python3 pub.py
   ```

4. **Test Multi-Protocol**
   - Publish to MQTT
   - Verify in Zenoh subscriber
   - Check ROS2 topics (if applicable)

### Integration Tests

If adding test scripts:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test-integration.sh

set -e

echo "Starting services..."
docker-compose up -d

echo "Waiting for services to be ready..."
sleep 10

echo "Testing MQTT to Zenoh bridge..."
# Add test commands

echo "All tests passed!"
```

### Performance Testing

For performance-critical changes:

```bash
# Measure message throughput
docker-compose logs zenoh-router | grep -c "published"

# Check latency
# Use timestamps in messages to measure end-to-end latency
```
